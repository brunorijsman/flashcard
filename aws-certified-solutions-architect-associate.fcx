Q: What is the default behavior of a security group for outbound traffic?
A: Allow all outbound traffic by default; there is a default rule that allows all traffic (you can delete this rule if you want). 

Q: What does it mean that the source for the default security group of a VPC is the security group itself?
A: It specifies the rules for communications between instances that are attached to the same VPC.

Q: Can you block a specific IP address using a security group?
A: No, use an Access Control List (ACL) instead.

SubTopic: Lab: Upgrading EBS Volume Types

Lab: Upgrading EBS Volume Types
Step: Create a t2.micro Amazon Linux instance with 3 extra volumes: Magnetic, ST1, SC1.
Step: Take a note of the availability zone of the instance and the volumes.
Step: Try to change the size and type of each attached volume, and observe which changes are allowed and which not.
Step: Pick a non-root volume and create a copy of it in another AZ in the same region.
Step: Pick a non-root volume and create a copy of it in another region.
Step: Install and configure Apache to start at boot. Create a small website and verify it works.
Step: Create an AMI from the instance.
Step: Launch a new EC2 instance from the new AMI, and verify it behaves as a web server.
Step: Clean up: delete EC2 instances, security groups, keypairs, snapshots, and images in all regions.

Q: Can you mount an EBS volume in one AZ to an EC2 instance in a different AZ?
A: No.

Q: How can you see which volume in the volume list is the root volume?
A: It is based of a snapshot.

Q: Can you change the size of a volume on-the-fly (without affecting a running attached EC2 instance)?
A: Yes, but not for Magnetic (= Standard) volumes.

Q: Can you change the type of a volume on-the-fly (without affecting a running attached EC2 instance)?
A: Yes, but not for Magnetic (= Standard) volumes.

Q: How can you copy an EBS volume to a different AZ in the same region?
A: Create a snapshot of the volume, and create a new volume from the snapshot in the other AZ.

Q: How can you copy an EBS volume to a different region?
A: Create a snapshot of the volume, copy the snapshot to a different region, and create a new volume from the snapshot in the other region.

Q: How can you copy an EC2 instance to another region?
A: Create a image from the instance, copy the image to the other region, boot an instance from the copied image.

Q: How do you create a new AMI from a running EC2 instance?
A: Create a snapshot of the root volume, and convert the snapshot into an image.

Q: What is a snapshot?
A: A point in time copy of a volume.

Q: What happens if you take multiple snapshots of the same volume at different points in time?
A: Snapshots are incremental: only the deltas as stored.

Q: How long does it take to take a snapshot?
A: The first snapshot takes long (minutes). Subsequent snapshots are incremental and hence faster.

Q: Can you take a snapshot of the root volume while the instance is running?
A: It is technically possible but not wise; you should stop the instance.

Q: Name 2 things that you can use as the source for creating an AMI.
A: EC2 instance, EBS snapshot.

Q: Where are snapshots stored?
A: On S3 (although you don't see a bucket with the snapshots in them).

A: Yes.

Q: If a volume is restored from an encrypted snapshot, is the volume encrypted?
A: Yes.

Q: Can you share an unencrypted snapshot with another user?
A: Yes, you can share it with another account or make it completely public.

Q: Can you share an encrypted snapshot with another user?
A: No, they will not be able to restore a volume from it.

SubTopic: Lab: Encrypt Root Device Volume and Create an AMI

Lab: Encrypt Root Device Volume and Create an AMI
Step: Create a t2.micro Amazon Linux instance.

Step: SSH into the newly created instance.
Step: Clean up: delete EC2 instances, security groups, keypairs, snapshots, and images in all regions.

Q: Why are public and community AMIs never encrypted?
A: Because encrypted images and volumes use a key that is tied to the user.

A: EBS Backed and Instance Store Backed (aka Ephemeral Store).

Q: Name 5 criteria that you can select an AMI on.

A: No, you can only reboot or terminate it.

Q: Can you detach an EBS Backed volume from an EC2 instance and attach it to some other instance?
A: Yes, even if it is the root volume.

Q: Can you detach an Instance Store Backed volume from an EC2 instance and attach it to some other instance?
A: No, is is actually not even a volume and doesn't appear in the volume list.

Q: How is the data for an EBS Backed Volume stored?
A: Redundantly across multiple physical servers within an AZ. It can survive the loss of a physical server.

Q: How is the data for an Instance Store Backed Volume stored?
A: Non-redundantly (ephemerally) only on the same physical server that hosts the EC2 instance. It cannot survive the loss of that physical server.

Q: Name 2 reasons for stopping an EC2 instance.
A: To take a snapshot, to move it to another hypervisor in an attempt to resolve a failed status check.

Q: What is the main reason that Instance Store Backed Volumes exist?
A: For historical reasons: this was the only type of volume that AWS used to support before EBS Backed Volumes were introduced later.

Q: How is an EBS Backed root volume created?
A: It is an EBS volume created from an EBS snapshot.

Q: How is an EBS Backed root volume created?
A: It is an Instance Store volume created from a template stored in S3.

A: An EBS Backed Volume is created faster.

Q: What is another name for Ephemeral Storage?
A: Instance Store Backed Storage or Instance Store Backed Volumes or simply Instance Store Volumes.

Q: What happens if you terminate an Instance Store Backed EC2 Instance?
A: The data is always lost, you cannot configure EC2 to keep the root device volume.
