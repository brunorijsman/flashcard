Id: 1322
Answer: NAT instance and NAT gateway.

Question: Which NAT mechanism is deprecated?
Id: 1323
Answer: NAT instances; they are being replaced by NAT gateways.

Question: What does NAT stand for?
Id: 1324
Answer: Network Address Translation.

Question: What is a typical use case for NAT?
Id: 1325
Answer: Give EC2 instances on private subnets outbound access to the public Internet.

Question: What is source / destination check?
Id: 1326
Answer: Only allow traffic whose source or destination address is the IP address of the EC2 instance.

Question: What must you not forget to do after you launch a NAT instance?
Id: 1327
Answer: Disable source / destination check.

Question: What subnet should you put a NAT instance in?
Id: 1328
Answer: A public subnet; the NAT instance needs to be reachable from the public Internet.

Question: How should routing be configured for a NAT instance?
Id: 1329
Answer: The route table for the private subnets that want outbound reachability to the Internet should have a default route to the NAT instance.

Question: Why do you need to disable source / destination check for NAT instances?
Id: 1330
Answer: Because it is forwarding traffic on behalf of other EC2 instances.

Question: What happens if a NAT instance fails?
Id: 1331
Answer: You lose Internet connectivity; the NAT instance is a single point of failure and a throughput bottleneck (unless you use complex scripts).

Question: What is the difference between a NAT gateway and an Egress Only Internet Gateway?

Question: Can you associate a single NACL with multiple subnets?
Id: 1351
Answer: Yes.

Question: Which NACLs are created automatically and what is their default behavior?
Id: 1352
Answer: One NACL is automatically created for each VPC. It allows all inbound and outbound traffic.

Question: What common mistake in NACL configuration prevents client-server TCP connections from working?
Id: 1353
Answer: Add a custom TCP rule allowing ephemeral ports (1024-65535) for inbound and/or outbound traffic depending on which side the client is.

Id: 1393
Answer: Simple Notification Services (SNS) or Message Queue (MQ).

Question: What is the SNS visibility time-out window?
Id: 1394
Answer: When a message is delivered to a consumer, it is marked invisible. If the consumer fails to process it within the timeout, it is marked visible again and re-delivered.

Question: What is the maximum visbility time-out?
Id: 1395
Answer: 12 hours.

Question: What is the main purpose of SQS in terms of application systems architecture?
Id: 1396

Answer: Text data in any format (XML, JSON, unformated text, ...)

Question: Does an SQS message contain binary data?
Id: 1399
Answer: No, it contains text data.

Question: How does SQS interact with EC2 auto-scaling?
Id: 1400
Answer: EC2 auto-scaling groups can grow based on the number of messages in an SQS queue.

Question: How are SQS messages delivered to an application?
Id: 1401
Answer: Applications use the SQS API to poll a message queue and retrieve messages.

Question: How can SQS help to provide elasticity for bursty workloads?
Id: 1402
Answer: You can create an auto-scaling group of EC2 instances that consume the messages and make the auto-scaling group grow when the queue becomes too long.

Question: What are the two types of SQS queues?
Id: 1403
Answer: Standard queues and FIFO queues.

Question: What is the default queue type in SQS?
Id: 1404
Answer: Standard queue.

Question: Name 3 ways in which an SQS standard queue differs from a FIFO queue.
Id: 1405
Answer: Maximum throughput, delivery guarantee, ordering guarantee

Question: How does an SQS standard queue differ from a FIFO queue in terms of number of maximum throughput?
Id: 1406
Answer: Standard queues have no pre-determined limit on the throughput, FIFO queues limit throughput to 300 transaction per second (TPS).

Question: How does an SQS standard queue differ from a FIFO queue in terms of delivery guarantee?
Id: 1407
Answer: Standard queues deliver the message at least one (but sometimes multiple times), FIFO queues guarantee exactly one delivery.

Question: How does an SQS standard queue differ from a FIFO queue in terms of ordered guarantee?
Id: 1408
Answer: Standard queues usually deliver the messages in-order (but sometimes out-of-order), FIFO queues guarantee in-order delivery within a message group.

Question: What is a message group in SQS?
Id: 1409
Answer: Messages within a message group are delivered in-order. Messages in different message groups may be delivered out-of-order.

Question: Do SQS standard queues support message groups?
Id: 1410
Answer: No, only FIFO queues support message groups.

Question: How long can an SQS message stay in the queue?
Id: 1411
Answer: You can configure the retention time between 1 minute and 14 days; the default is 4 days.

Question: What is the SQS retention time?
Id: 1412
Answer: The maximum time a message can spend in a queue. One the retention limit is reached, the message is deleted.

Question: What is the difference between SQS short polling and long polling?
Id: 1413
Answer: Short polling returns immediately, even if there is no message. Long polling blocks util a message is available (or until a time-out occurs).

Question: What is a DockerFile?
Id: 1742
Answer: A text document that contains instructions on how to assemble a Docker image.

Question: What is a Docker instruction?
Id: 1743
Answer: A DockerFile contains a sequence of instructions (e.g. FROM, RUN, ADD, COPY), each of which adds a layer to the Docker image.

Question: What is a Docker build?
Id: 1744
Answer: The Docker build process executes the instructions in a DockerFile and constructs a DockerImage.

Question: What is the Docker daemon?
Id: 1745
Answer: A long running process that manages the lifecycle of Docker resources (images, containers, networks, etc.)

Question: What is the Docker engine?
Id: 1746
Answer: A client-server application that hosts the Docker daemon, provides a CLI and an API.

Question: What host OS does the Docker engine run on natively?
Id: 1747
Answer: On Linux.

Question: Is Docker supported on Windows and MacOS?
Id: 1748
Answer: Yes, in those cases the Docker engine runs in a VM that runs Linux, and the Docker containers are nested within that VM.

Question: What is the Docker client?
Id: 1749
Answer: A Command Line Interface (CLI) that you use to interact with the Docker engine (start and stop container, add and delete images, etc.)

Question: What is a Docker registry?
Id: 1750
Answer: A central repository where you can store and retrieve Docker images, available in multiple tagged versions.

Question: Are Docker registries public or private?
Id: 1751
Answer: Both are availble.

Id: 1752
Answer: Elastic Container Registry.

Question: What service does AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) povide?
Id: 1753
Answer: It is the container registry in AWS ECR.

Question: What is the Docker Hub?
Id: 1754
Answer: A cloud-based Docker registry run by docker.com.

Question: What does EKS stand for?
Id: 1755
Answer: Elastic Kubernetes Service.

Question: What is Kubernetes?
Id: 1756
Answer: An orchestration system for containers.

Question: What is the difference between ECS and EKS?
Id: 1757
Answer: ECS is docker containers as a service does not come with Kubernetes but instead provides some AWS-proprietary orchestration features. EKS is AWS Kubernetes-as-a-Service integrated with other AWS services.

Question: What is AWS Fargate?
Id: 1758
Answer: Amazon's proprietary container orchestration system. It is the technology behind ECS and EKS.

Question: What is the scope of ECS?
Id: 1759
Answer: Region.

Question: In ECS, who manages the cluster configuration and management system?
Id: 1760
Answer: Amazon does.

Question: What are the main ECS abstractions?
Id: 1761
Answer: Clusters, services, task definition, task.

Question: What is an ECS cluster?
Id: 1762
Answer: A pool of compute resources, available to host a logical grouping of services and tasks.

Question: What is the scope of an ECS cluster?
Id: 1763
Answer: Region.

Question: What are the 2 launch type for ECS clusters
Id: 1764
Answer: Fargate and EC2.

Question: What is an ECS service?
Id: 1765
Answer: A logical grouping of tasks that collectively provide a service in micro services architecture. The desired number of tasks is determined by the scaling and redundancy requirements.

Question: What is an ECS task definition?
Id: 1766
Answer: All the information that is needed to launch a task (which docker image, how much memory and CPU, what networking mode, etc.)

Question: What is a task?
Id: 1767
Answer: A grouping of running container (defined by a task definition, and running as part of a service hosted in a cluster).

Question: How is a task started?
Id: 1768
Answer: It can be started manually (for batch jons) or automatically "scheduled" by a scheduler (for long-running services).

Question: What are the two types of task schedulers in ECS?
Id: 1769
Answer: The Amazon-provided service scheduler or custom (3rd party) schedulers.

Question: What the the Amazon-provided service scheduler do?
Id: 1770
Answer: It ensures that the appropriate number of tasks is running to provide a long-running service. It can dynamically restart failed tasks and scale up or down.

Question: How does ECS integrated with ELB?
Id: 1771
Answer: The Service Scheduler can automatically register tasks in a service with a load balancer.

Question: What happens if a task fails?
Id: 1772
Answer: The service scheduler can automatically restart the task to maintain the desired count of tasks in the service

Question: What is the ECS Container Agent?
Id: 1773
Answer: An agent that must be installed in the Virtual Machine (i.e. EC2 instance) that hosts the containers. The agent communicates with Amazon's cluster management system.

Question: Is the ECS Container Agent open source?
Id: 1774
Answer: Yes, it is written in Go and available on Github.

Question: For which EC2 instances does Amazon officially support the Container Agent?
Id: 1775
Answer: Amazon only supports running the unmodified Container Agent on Linux EC2 instances (not Windows). The agent is included in certain Amazon-provided AMIs.

Question: Can you attach a security group to an individual container or task or service?
Id: 1776
Answer: No, security groups are applied to EC2 instances that host the containers.

Question: What are the ECS soft limits (and their defaults)?
Id: 1777
Answer: Clusters per region (1000), instances per cluster (1000), services per cluster (500).

Question: What are the ECS hard limits?
Id: 1778
Answer: One load balancer per service, 1000 desired taks per service, 10 containers per task, 10 tasks per instance.
